                        EXERCISE QUESTIONS
Exercise 1:
Write a script that will visualize discrete waveforms of 
periodic signals. Note that the time scale must be dis
crete and observe the changes.

Exercise 2:
Write a script that will visualize both the growing and 
decaying exponentials. Note that the time scale must 
be continuous and observe the changes.

Exercise 3:
Write a script that will visualize three rectangular pulse
s of v1, v2 and v1-v2.
• 1000 samples indicate the interval of one second 
• a gap of 2 ms

Exercise 4: 
Write a script that will visualize ramp functions and me
rge them with a unit-amplitude step function is gener
ated using ones (amplitude = 1). Note that the concat
enation is performed using square braces in Matlab.
• [A B ] or [A, B] -> row-wise concatenation
• [A; B] -> column-wise concatenation 
• Make sure that dimensions must comply accordingly
